# Czech Adjectives Rating Project

## The aim of this project

This project is designed to collect user ratings for a set of Czech adjectives based on their perceived valence (positive, neutral, negative) and arousal (high, medium, low).

The application is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and uses Firebase Firestore for data storage. Hosted on GitHub Pages, this project allows users to interactively rate words and submit their responses to the Firestore database.
Features

*Adjective Display*: Randomly displays an adjective from a Firestore database.
*Rating System*: Users can rate each adjective based on valence and arousal through a simple interface.
*Data Collection*: Ratings are stored in Firebase Firestore, with each adjective tracked by how many times it has been rated to prevent skewing data from overexposure.

## Technologies Used

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend presentation and interaction logic.
Firebase Firestore: Used for storing adjective data and user ratings.
GitHub Pages: Hosts the static website.

## The project was created in colaboration with the department of psychology at the Univeristy of Ostrava.
