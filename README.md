# Czech Adjectives Rating Project
## Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to collect user ratings for a set of Czech adjectives based on their perceived valence (positive, neutral, negative) and arousal (high, medium, low).

## Description

This application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses Firebase Firestore for data storage. Hosted on GitHub Pages, it allows users to interactively rate words and submit their responses to the Firestore database.

## Features

Adjective Display: Randomly displays an adjective from a Firestore database.
Rating System: Users can rate each adjective based on valence and arousal through a simple interface.
Data Collection: Ratings are stored in Firebase Firestore, with each adjective tracked by how many times it has been rated to prevent data skewing from overexposure.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend presentation and interaction logic.
- Firebase Firestore: For storing adjective data and user ratings.
- GitHub Pages: For hosting the static website.

This project was created in collaboration with the Department of Psychology at the University of Ostrava.
